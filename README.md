# MonthSortFolder

## Installation ways

1. Use this Bash script:

```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed  "./app/main.py"
```

2. Use this powershell script:
```powershell
@echo off
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed  "./app/main.py"
```

3. Just download from [releases page] (https://github.com/miuruwa/MonthSortFolder/releases) to avoid a usage of terminal `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Then from these 3 ways you got an .exe file, you need to replace it to folder where you need to sort files by month. and create a label to it on desktop.

## Usage

* Double click on label -> open actual month (your path + `2. february` for example)  
* Drag your files onto label -> move that to folder

Just enjoy it.
